# LineAlert

### [LineAlert](https://aa-linealert.herokuapp.com/)

LineAlert is a NYC subway alert application where users can create live alerts as they see them, notifying anyone who uses the application.

## Background and Overview

There is currently no alert system for anyone using the subway system in NYC. We want to create an application where users can notify others, of any suspicious events at the current station and anything that might cause delays to their commute. This would be beneficial to all residents who use the subway system as well as tourists alike.

We will need to:
* Build a database to store NYC subway stations with names, lattitude and longitude, and all intersecting lines
* Allow all users to view alerts but only authenticated users to have full CRUD functionality
* Utilize Google Maps API to design a seamless map with dynamic markers of all stations
* Include a search feature where users can create their path and view all alerts on that path

LineAlert is built with the MERN stack, a combination of following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

## Functionality and MVP

- [ ] Customized map using Google Maps API to display only transit layer, can be toggled on or off
- [ ] Dynamic color coded markers (depending on hazard level) will pop up as alerts are created
- [ ] Option to view all alerts on right navigation or on-click on any markers on the map
- [ ] Search feature for directions from an origin to a destination will display a polyline on the map, also showing where alerts are on the route

## Bonus Features

- [ ] Route rerouting when there are alerts on the route
- [ ] Increase application functionality to all 5 boroughs of NYC
- [ ] Instant message system for users to receive alerts based on their time preference
